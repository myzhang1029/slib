# hist
Here I keep the older versions of slib (which I wrote really really long ago).
It's normal to have too many typos here, since I was in Primary School
back then.  
Semantic versioning started at v2.2.0, the versioning scheme before that
is unknown, that is, for the first few revisions, I did't name any release,
then sometimes I used "12" to prefix some versions.
(I really didn't understand myself!)  
Those days I didn't know about git, so I "develop"ed with notepad++,
CFree (an IDE), and iEditor (an editor for iOS), and transmitted the files
with email and net disk.  
For the history of this project, see README.md at the root directory.
